WELCOME TO SET OPERATION PROGRAM !

This program make some operations on sets of numbers by your choise,
such as union, intersection, subtraction ect.
Here are some guidelines for understanding the usage of the program:

# The operations you can make on sets are: read_set, print_set,
union_set, intersect_set, sub_set, symdiff_set ,stop.

# The sets names you can make some operations on are: SETA, SETB,
SETC, SETD, SETE, SETF.

# The valid range of numbers is 0-127.

# To perform read_set, type:
read_set <SETNAME>,<number>,...,<number>,-1
For example: read_set SETA, 23, 1, 89, 45, -1

# To perform print_set, type:
print_set <SETNAME>
For example: print_set SETA

# To perform union_set/intersect_set/sub_set/syndiff_set, type:
<operation> <SETNAME1>,<SETNAME2>,<SETNAME3>
For example: union_set SETA, SETB, SETF

#To exit the program, all you have to do is type ''stop''

lets start! write your first commend here: 
input is: read_set  	SETA ,1,2,3,4,5,-1


Done! type in the next command: 
input is:   	read_set SETB,   5, 6, 7,8,9 ,-1


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: union_set SETA, SETB 	, SETC


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: print_set SETC


SETC: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 

Done! type in the next command: 
input is: read_set SETD ,2,4,6,8,-1


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: sub_set SETC, SETD, SETE


Done! type in the next command: 
input is:  print_set 	SETE


SETE: 1 3 5 7 9 

Done! type in the next command: 
input is: symdiff_set SETA, SETE, SETF


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: print_set SETA


SETA: 1 2 3 4 5 

Done! type in the next command: 
input is: print_set SETF  


SETF: 2 4 7 9 

Done! type in the next command: 
input is: read_set SETA ,10,20,30,40,50,-1


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: read_set SETB, 40,50,60,70,-1


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: intersect_set SETB, SETA, SETF


Done! type in the next command: 
input is: print_set SETF	


SETF: 40 50 

Done! type in the next command: 
input is: stop   

i guess thats it, see you next time!

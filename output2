WELCOME TO SET OPERATION PROGRAM !

This program make some operations on sets of numbers by your choise,
such as union, intersection, subtraction ect.
Here are some guidelines for understanding the usage of the program:

# The operations you can make on sets are: read_set, print_set,
union_set, intersect_set, sub_set, symdiff_set ,stop.

# The sets names you can make some operations on are: SETA, SETB,
SETC, SETD, SETE, SETF.

# The valid range of numbers is 0-127.

# To perform read_set, type:
read_set <SETNAME>,<number>,...,<number>,-1
For example: read_set SETA, 23, 1, 89, 45, -1

# To perform print_set, type:
print_set <SETNAME>
For example: print_set SETA

# To perform union_set/intersect_set/sub_set/syndiff_set, type:
<operation> <SETNAME1>,<SETNAME2>,<SETNAME3>
For example: union_set SETA, SETB, SETF

#To exit the program, all you have to do is type stop
